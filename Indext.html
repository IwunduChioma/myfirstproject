                A program to a computer is a lot like a recipe for a cook in the kitchen.
                 When a cook follows a recipe, he or she must follow each step to be successful with that recipe.
                  You as a programmer must create a program so that your computer does exactly what you want it to do.
                   And keep in mind, your computer will do exactly what you tell it.  
                   That means if you say something incorrectly, your computer 
                   will try to do it incorrectly. This is where errors arise. In programming talk, 
                   we call such errors bugs. The better you get at programming, 
                   the fewer bugs you will have in your programs and the more likely 
                that a computer will do exactly what you want it to do.

                There are so many languages to choose from, one of the things you 
                will have to decide is exactly what kind of programming you want to do. 
                Do you want to create webpages? If so, they use their own set of languages 
                that are not true programming languages. These languages have names such 
                as HTML and CSS. But other, more traditional programming languages can 
                interact with HTML and CSS. This is why the world of programming today 
                can seem extremely complicated to a newcomer. To create an interactive webpage, 
                for example, you might have to learn all three of these languages
